0. Define Variables:
0.1 int year, answer, nextLeap, zellerDay
0.2 boolean repeat, leap
0.3 String day
0.4 int nextLeap

Algorithm to take user inputted year and determine if it was a leap year

START
1. Set repeat = true. 
2. Repeat program WHILE repeat = true : 
3. Ask user to input a year greater than 1582: "Please input a year after 1582."
4. year <<< user input
5. Validate input
	5.1 If year <= 1582, set repeat = false
	5.2 Otherwise, check if year is leap year
	5.3 If num is not leap year:
		5.3.1 Set repeat = false
6. If year is valid:
	6.1 Plug year into a method zeller()
	6.2 zellerDay <<< day of Feb 29 on that year
	6.3 day <<< zellerDay converted to corresponding day of the week
	6.4 Repeat UNTIL nextLeap = zellerDay
		6.4.1 year = year + 4
		6.4.2 check if year is leap year
			6.4.2.1 if not leap year, year = year + 4
		6.4.3 nextLeap <<< day of feb 29 on that year (use zeller() method)
	6.5 nextLeap <<< year
	6.6 Output year
7. Ask user if they want to repeat program: "Input 1 for yes, input 2 for no"
	7.1 If answer = 2, set repeat = false;
8. STOP
