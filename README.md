Practice with top-down design and using methods to achieve abstraction - Completed Oct 2022

External documentation includes the algorithm I designed for the program. The program prompts the user to enter a year after 1582, then returns whether the year entered is a leap year. If yes, it uses Zeller's Congruence to determine the day of the week that Feb 29 fell on that year, and the next leap year where Feb 29 falls on the same weekday. The program runs until the user wishes to stop, whereby they enter [1] for yes (continue program) and [2] for no (stop program).
